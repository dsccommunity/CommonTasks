[[dscyml_sqlendpoints_abstract]]
.The {YmlCategory} DSC resource is used to create an endpoint. Currently it only supports creating a database mirror and a service broker endpoint. A database mirror endpoint can be used by AlwaysOn.

> The endpoint will be started after creation, but will not be enforced unless the the parameter State is specified. To set connect permission to the endpoint, please use the resource SqlEndpointPermission.
