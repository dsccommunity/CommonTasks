.When to use '{YmlCategory}'
****
Use this resource when you need to create and manage DHCP scopes that define the IP address ranges available for dynamic allocation. It provides a comprehensive scope configuration including IP exclusion ranges, scope-level options, server-level options, and IP reservations for specific devices. For a full DHCP server setup from scratch, consider using DhcpServer instead.
****

An IP-address scope is a consecutive range of possible IP addresses that the DHCP server can lease to clients on a subnet.
