.When to use '{YmlCategory}'
****
Use this resource when you need to install roles and features on a Windows Server (e.g., Web-Server, DNS, AD-Domain-Services, Failover-Clustering). This is one of the most commonly used resources and is typically applied early in a server configuration to enable the platform capabilities required by other resources. For Windows client, use WindowsOptionalFeatures instead.
