:abstract:    {YmlCategory} manages files, folders, and their NTFS access permissions on the target node.

[#dscyml_filesandfolders]
= DSC Resource '{YmlCategory}'


[[dscyml_filesandfolders_abstract, {abstract}]]
{abstract}

.When to use '{YmlCategory}'
****
Use this resource when you need to ensure specific files or folders exist with the correct content and NTFS permissions. It handles creating directory structures, copying files, and setting fine-grained NTFS ACLs including inheritance and propagation rules.

| - Directory
  - *File* (default)
  - BinaryFile

| MatchSource
|
| Boolean
| Determines if the resource should monitor for new files added to the source directory after the initial copy.

A value of `True` indicates that, after the initial copy, any new source files should be copied to the destination.

[NOTE]
====
If you do not specify a value for `Credential`, the resource will use the computer account of the target node to access the SourcePath.
When the SourcePath is a UNC share, this could result in an `Access Denied` error.
Please ensure your permissions are set accordingly, or use the `Credential` property to specify the account that should be used.
