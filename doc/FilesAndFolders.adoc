| Parameter
| Attribute
| DataType
| Description
| Allowed Values

| DestinationPath
|
| String
| The location on the target node

NOTE: The specified path must be accessible by the target node.
| 

| Attributes
|
| String
| The desired state of the attributes for the targeted file or directory.
| - Archive
  - Hidden
  - ReadOnly
  - System

| Checksum
|
| String
| The checksum type to use when determining whether two files are the same.
| - CreatedDate
  - ModifiedDate
  - SHA-1
  - SHA-256
  - SHA-512

| Contents
|
| String
| Indicates the contents to Ensure are `Present` or `Absent` from the targeted file.

NOTE: Only valid when used with Type `File`.
|

| ContentFromFile
|
| String
| Loading contents from the specified file during DSC configuration build and append the loaded content to the `Contents` attribute

NOTE: Only valid when used with type `File` and mandatory with type `BinaryFile`.

IMPORTANT: The specified path must be accessible at compile time.
|

| Credential
|
| PSCredential
| The credentials that are required to access resources, such as source files.
|

| Force
|
| Boolean
| Overrides access operations that would result in an error (such as overwriting a file or deleting a directory that is not empty).
| - *False* (default)
  - True

| Recurse
|
| Boolean
| Only valid when used with Type Directory.
  Performs the state operation recursively to all directory content, subdirectories, and subdirectory content.
| - *False* (default)
  - True

| SourcePath
|
| String
| The path from which to copy the file or folder resource.

NOTE: The specified path must be accessible by the target node.
|

| Type
|
| String
| The type of resource being configured.

IMPORTANT: The type `BinaryFile` embeds a bas64 encoded file stream in the compiled MOF file and can exceed the default `MaxEnvelopeSizeKb` of 500KB.

NOTE: The type `BinaryFile` supports only the attributes `ContentFromFile`, `DestinationPath`, `Ensure`. A SHA256 checksum is used to identify file content changes.
| - Directory
  - *File* (default)
  - BinaryFile

| MatchSource
|
| Boolean
| Determines if the resource should monitor for new files added to the source directory after the initial copy.

A value of `True` indicates that, after the initial copy, any new source files should be copied to the destination. 
If set to `False`, the resource caches the contents of the source directory and ignores any files added after the initial copy.
| - *False* (default)
  - True

| Ensure
|
| String
| Determines whether the file and Contents at the Destination should exist or not.

  Set this property to `Present` to ensure the file exists.
  Set it to `Absent` to ensure they do not exist.
| - *Present* (default)
  - Absent

[NOTE]
====
If you do not specify a value for `Credential`, the resource will use the computer account of the target node to access the SourcePath.
When the SourcePath is a UNC share, this could result in an `Access Denied` error.
Please ensure your permissions are set accordingly, or use the `Credential` property to specify the account that should be used.
